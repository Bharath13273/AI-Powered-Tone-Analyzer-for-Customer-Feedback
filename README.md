AI-Powered Tone Analyzer & Auto Email Responder for Customer Feedback
This is a Streamlit web application that uses Google Gemini (Generative AI) to analyze the tone of user comments or complaints from an Excel sheet. The app allows users to upload an Excel file containing Username, Email, Product, and User Comment, and then detects the emotional tone of each comment using Geminiâ€™s language model.
Based on the detected tone, the app automatically generates a polite and helpful response for each user comment. Additionally, it can send these AI-generated replies directly to users via email, enabling efficient and personalized customer support.
